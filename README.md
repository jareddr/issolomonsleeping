Is Solomon Sleeping
===============

This is a quick meteor project I threw together to keep track of my baby's sleeping patterns.

We've been struggling with a serious lack of sleep at night, so it's time to get scientific about it.

Tapping a link will toggle the start and end of a sleeping period.  The data is all stored for graphing and summary analysis.

Simply run meteor inside this directory to start the project.
